# Welcome to my researches notes !

Here, you can expect to find researches I made on multiple domains.

Most of my researches will simply be compilations of informations found on the internet about certain domains, but I'll try my best to share those in the most understandable format possible ;)

### What I might make posts about :

- Low level (C, ASM...)
- Networking
- Forensic
- Anything I find intresting enough to post about 

## Please note :

I'm only a student, so I sometimes makes mistakes.

If you find anything wrong on a post I made, feel free to use the comment section to point it out.

I'll try to keep a look on the comments sections, and correct myself in case of error !

## PS:

I want to quote the following two blogs for being really intresting, and inspiring :

- [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/)
- [https://h0mbre.github.io/](https://h0mbre.github.io/)
